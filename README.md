A roguelike-like, made by me!

Enter The Long Corridor, said to have many treasures hidden within!
Or maybe it's just a tourist trap. Who knows?

Will you find riches, or will you find death? Or perhaps... you will find both?

INSTRUCTIONS

The point of the game is to make it to the end of the corridor with the highest score possible.

You can gain score through gold, which is found by defeating monsters and exploring pits.

Type 'walk' or just 'w' to advance to the next room. If you find yourself in front of a pit, you can 'jump' or 'j' over it!
(Then again you could walk into it, if you're into that kind of stuff)
You can also use the 'search' command (or 's') to look for clues that help you identify the kind of pit you are looking at... or spit down the pit and hear what your saliva hits.


'Fight' or 'f' monsters to continue your journey. Everytime you enter 'fight', you will deal your DMG to the monster and it will do the same to you. Don't risk your life if you know you can't handle it!

Shops appear from time to time, and they sell items that you can 'use'. 'Pay' the shops to see what they're selling, and if you're interested, you can exchange your gold for the goods!

If you're low on health or energy, be sure to 'wait' or 'wa'. Waiting increases your health by 1 and NRG by 2. Unless of course you're really tired and end up sleeping on the spot... but who would do that?
Don't wait too long, because there have been reports of a strange dark cloud that feasts on adventurers who don't move on in time. Flashlights usually help to delay this... thing.

Remember, losing is fun!

...right?
